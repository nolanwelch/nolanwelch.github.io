I’m Nolan. I’m a linguist, developer, and humanist who likes building things that bridge the gap between people and ideas. I graduated from UNC Chapel Hill in 2025 with degrees in Computer Science and Hispanic Linguistics, where I explored how language, both spoken and coded, shapes the way we see the world.

To wit, I've worked as:

- A marketing (and later operations) executive for a [student-run escape room startup](https://chapelthrillescapes.com/)
- A Spanish translator and interpreter ([yes, there's a difference](https://www.atanet.org/client-assistance/what-is-the-difference-between-translation-and-interpreting/))
- A neuroscience lab technician at FIU (my current role!)
- A Kumon grader, a fundraising cold-caller ($53k in 9 months!), and a skating rink attendant

...Not necessarily in that order. My broad work experience, coupled with my strongly interdisciplinary academic interests, have given me a unique appreciation for overlaps, intersections, midpoints, and all things best considered jointly.

When I'm not building things or writing code, I'm listening to a multilingual blend of music (eight languages, at last count), catching up on the past few centuries of literature, and translating Abril Posas' _El triunfo de la memoria_.
