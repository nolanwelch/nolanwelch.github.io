# Hey, I'm Nolan.

I'm a recent graduate from UNC Chapel Hill, where I dual-majored in **Computer Science** and **Hispanic Linguistics**. I'm passionate about computational linguistics and plan to pursue a PhD in this field. 

I love exploring the intersection of language, technology, and culture, and I'm always on the lookout for projects that challenge me to blend these interests. 

Check out my projects, blog posts, or get in touch if you'd like to connect.
